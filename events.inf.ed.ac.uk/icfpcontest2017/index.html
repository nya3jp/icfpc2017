<h1 id="vm-update">VM update</h1>

<p>We have uploaded an updated version of the
<a href="http://events.inf.ed.ac.uk/icfpcontest2017/static/vm-readme.md">VM</a>. A
number of other requests have come in and we will upload a further
update early next week.</p>

<p>We recognise that some participants may only realise that they want to
use a particular tool or library once they know what the task is. That
should be fine providing the requested package is reasonably easy to
install on the VM and you include installation instructions along with
your submission.</p>

<p>We will give full details of the submission process along with the
task description next Friday.</p>

<p>The contest begins in two weeks time. Here is some preliminary
information about the rules.</p>

<h1 id="teams">Teams</h1>

<p>Each participant must be a member of exactly one team. Teams may not
divide or collaborate with one another once the contest has
begun. There is no limit to the number of members of a single team.</p>

<h1 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual property</h1>

<p>Contest participants retain ownership of all intellectual property
rights in and to any submitted source codes, custom tools, and related
materials (“Submissions”) that participants had before submission. As
a condition of entry, participants grant the judges a non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use,
reproduce, publish, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display
the Submissions for the purposes of allowing the judges to test and
evaluate the Submissions for purposes of the contest.</p>

<p>Welcome to the official website for the ICFP Programming Contest 2017,
the 20th instance of the annual programming contest series sponsored
by <a href="http://icfpconference.org/">The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming</a>.</p>

<p>This year’s contest is brought to you by <a href="http://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/">LFCS</a> at the
<a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk">University of Edinburgh</a>. It will be held for 72 hours, starting
from <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20170804T13&amp;p0=304&amp;msg=Start+of+ICFP+Programming+Contest+2017&amp;font=sanserif">4th August 2017 12:00
UTC</a>
and <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20170807T13&amp;p0=304&amp;msg=End+of+ICFP+Programming+Contest+2017&amp;font=sanserif">7th August 2017 12:00
UTC</a>.</p>

<h1 id="task">Task</h1>

<p>The task will be published on this website when the contest
starts. Solutions must be submitted online before the contest
ends. Details of the submission procedure will be announced along with
the contest task.</p>

<p>The contest is open to everyone except for contest organisers, their
families, and members of their institutions. Neither advance
registration nor entry fee is required.</p>

<h1 id="programming-languages">Programming languages</h1>

<p>Any programming languages may be used as long as the submitted program
can be run by the judges on a standard Linux environment with external
network access disabled.</p>

<h1 id="environment">Environment</h1>

<p>The judging environment is a virtual machine running a recent version
of Debian with a selection of programming languages installed. It is
available as a Virtual Box image <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxr4F0XFjDDUdkZod1QyN09TYms">here</a>.</p>

<p>For further details take a look at the
<a href="http://events.inf.ed.ac.uk/icfpcontest2017/static/vm-readme.md">readme</a>,
which contains instructions and details the default languages and
environments that are installed.</p>

<p>Please let us know before the contest if you would like us to install
anything else.</p>

<h1 id="prizes">Prizes</h1>

<p>There will be prizes for the first and second place teams, the team
winning the (24 hour) lightning division, and a discretionary judges’
prize. The winners will be announced at ICFP 2017 in Oxford, UK, on
Tuesday 5th September 2017.</p>

<p>In addition, the organisers will declare during the conference that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the first place team’s language is “the programming language of choice for discriminating hackers”,</li>
  <li>the second place team’s language is “a fine tool for many applications”,</li>
  <li>the winning lightning division team’s language is “very suitable for rapid prototyping”, and</li>
  <li>the team winning the judges’ prize is “an extremely cool bunch of hackers”.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="updates">Updates</h1>
